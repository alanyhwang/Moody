# Mood Tracker

## Description

For people who are interested in tracking their own mood and
finding patterns on how certain events affect their mood.

This application allows users to keep track of their 
mood with each entry, ideally once a day. User will be
able to input a **mood** (for example happy or sad) and
be able to add in additional notes on why they may feel
that way. Each mood will have **tags** that indicate if
the mood is either _positive_, _positive-neutral_,
_neutral_, _negative-neutral_, or _negative_. Each tag
will be color coded from green (positive) to red
(negative). The user can add and define their own mood
with its associated tag. Anyone can use the mood tracker
to reflect on their day and find patterns on how certain
events can affect their mood in the long run.
